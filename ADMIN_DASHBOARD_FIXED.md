# Admin Dashboard - Fixed Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Connection Problem
- **Issue**: Config file had encoding issues causing wrong database name to be read
- **Fixed**: Recreated config file with proper encoding
- **Database**: `scop_resource_hub` with password `chalwad111`

### 2. Missing Admin User
- **Issue**: No admin user existed in the database
- **Fixed**: Created admin user in the users table
- **Credentials**: 
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`

### 3. Database Tables
- **Issue**: Some tables were missing (admin_users was created but AdminController uses users table)
- **Fixed**: Ensured all required tables exist and admin user is in the correct table

### 4. PYQ Upload Issue ⭐ NEW
- **Issue**: "Failed to add questions" error when uploading PYQ files
- **Root Cause**: `subject_id` column was NOT NULL but PYQ questions don't require subjects
- **Fixed**: 
  - Made `subject_id` column nullable: `ALTER TABLE resources MODIFY COLUMN subject_id INT(11) NULL`
  - Added description field to PYQ form for better data entry
  - Updated uploads directory permissions
  - Updated database schema in updates.sql
